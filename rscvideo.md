my name is sm. I am an associate professor of pharmacy and community health sciences where I hold a Canada Research Chair in p&ve. I am also the director of the UM VDEC which I founded in 2012. 

I consider myself very lucky not only because I started my work life selling watermelons on street corners in Libya, but because I get to do what I like the most which is learning new things in all kinds of fields and working on cracking hard problems such as how to prevent cancer.
